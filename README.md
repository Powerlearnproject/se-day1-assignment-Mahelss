Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the process of modelling a software which involves product design,development, testing ,deployment and maintenance 
importance- it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The development of programming languages eg python
-Establishment of software Engineering as a discipline 
-Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1. requirements- Gathering and Documenting user needs and system requirements 
 2. Design -Setting up detailed designs of the software 
 3. implementation- writing code and creating a solution using the computer 
 4. Testing-Conducting tests to check if it meets the standards and functional requirements 
 5. Deployment-Releasing the software  to users
 6.Maintenance -Providing ongoing support ,updates to enhance software after deployment 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison -Both follow sequential approach 
Contrast:
Waterfall- It's a sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements and design flowing downwards like a Waterfall.
Agile- Has an incremental approach focused on flexibility and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions 
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing tests 
Project Manager- Oversees the planing ,execution and delivery of software projects 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs- Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing and testing code Example: Visual studio
VCS - Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing requirements- requirements may change during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays 
-Tight Deadlines -Prssure to deliver software products on deliver software products on schedules can result in rushed development 
Technical debt -Accrued from shortcut solutions.
Strategies to overcome:
  1.Effective communication 
  2.Agile methodologies
  3. Regular reassessment of project goods and timelines
          

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 1. Unit -Testing individual components of software 
 2. Integration-Testing interactions between different components 
 3.System -Testing the entire software system as a whole 

4. Acceptance - Testing the software against user requirements 

Importance- Measures such as code reviews ,automated testing 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 
Prompt Engineering-Crafting questions or statements to get a clear  response.
importance-Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
     
Prompt- Platform for project 
Improved- Platform for Developer projects 
The improved is more effective as it enables the Ai to know that I'm looking for  a developer platform only
